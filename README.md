Part1:
    - Very clean code, and great use of numpy and matplotlib.
    - You have deomnstrated the ability to set a value for a whole row, or a bunch of points, but you didn't set the values correctly for the last row. It seems like you only set the very last cell to value 1, not all of the last row.

Part2:
    - Really good use of matplotlib and numpy. I cannot point at any redundancy in the code. Really good!
    - The plots are as expected too.
